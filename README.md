# Internship-STMicroelectronics
This project concerns the design of an oscilloscope on microcontroller that allows you to view the waveform of an analog voltage applied at the input. The system developed is based on a microcontroller with the necessary peripherals to the acquisition and digital conversion of an analog signal on a LCD screen. I worked to develop a software able to manage digital signal in order to show it on a LCD screen.

# Source code
The company didn't allow me to show the code, but you can view a report in italian in this [repository](https://github.com/Giuscar/Image-viewer-on-board-STM32f429I-DISCOVERY/blob/master/Monografia%20(italian).pdf)

# Result
There are some pictures available that show some results about what this software is able to do. In these pictures you can see an oscilloscope connected with the board. On the board the curve set on the oscilloscope will appear on the board screen.
These results are some examples:
